## Overview

This website was made with HTML, CSS and JS elements as part of a personal project. This was my first published website.

I tried to incorporate a responsive design with a blue colour scheme. However, I wasn't fully happy with the design and layout of it (especially on mobile), so eventually decided to create the website you're on now.
