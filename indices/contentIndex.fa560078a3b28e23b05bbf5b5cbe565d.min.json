Alpina are known for their tuning of BMW chassis platforms, tuned for the Autobahn and understated performance. The cars are, for the most part, bespoke to their BMW counterpart in that they share different VINs and engine components.\n\n## Brand restructure\n\nBMW says that this acquisition is part of a strategic remodel for the brand, as part of the company's move towards sustainable mobility and development of their M brand (now alongside Alpina). \n\nIt may well be a necessity, given the global and national movement towards electrification:\n\n\u003eThe transformation towards electromobility result in significantly higher risks for small-series manufacturers. \n\n\\- Andreas Bovensiepen, Alpina co-managing director\n\nBMW doesn't want the Alpina brand to go amiss, and so acquiring the operations of the company secures its future in the rocky landscape faced by car manufacturers at the moment.\n\n## Is Alpina's future doomed?\n\nGiving BMW free rein over Alpina's operations and models could spell disaster for the brand's heritage and exclusivity, given BMW's current peculiar decisions in terms of design and branding (the G80 M3 is one such example). So, what could realistically happen?\n\n### Alpina trim level\n\nOne such 'watering-down' could be in the form of condemning the brand to a simple trim level, in the same way that 'M-Sport' has become ubiquitous with a 190hp 320d  - not exactly the most worthy nameplate for such a vehicle. I'm not so sure whether adding an Alpina trim, alongside the M-Sport, would do wonders for the brand's image. The only real positive here is a wider recognition of the brand.\n\n### EV sub-brand?\n\nTurning Alpina into an electric sub-brand, in the same way Polestar has with Volvo, isn't out of the realm of possibility. At least this way, BMW has something to differentiate between ICE M vehicles and EV Alpina models. Again, it would also fit the concept of 'understated performance' which Alpina bases itself on. This is a viable idea, especially in terms of preserving the image of the company. That is, despite those who state that this would be the end of Alpina's legacy once and for all. \n\nHowever, BMW already has a dedicated EV vision - its 'i' brand. Mixing the two could spell confusion for consumers and the whole EV model range. Besides, by 2035 BMW is unlikely to have *any* ICE vehicles in its line-up - so is there any point in differentiating EV models? EVs will overshadow ICE vehicles very quickly in the next decade, rendering this contrast unnecessary.  \n\n### Worldwide expansion\n\nAmerican customers would appreciate a wider range of Alpina models in North America. At the moment, the US only receives the B7, B8 and XB7. Given BMW's financial backing, the addition of the well-loved B3 and smaller CUV models like the XB3 would widen product selection for North American customers.\n\nThis is especially true for the B3 Touring, since it would be a direct alternative to the M3 Touring (which isn't coming to the US, despite the cries of enthusiasts).\n\nFor now, the direction of Alpina is purely in BMW's hands. What happens next will have to be seen - although, there is still a lot of hope for the brand. Enthusiasts no doubt love the brand just as much as the people at BMW themselves do, so the future could be bright for Alpina.","lastmodified":"2022-04-06T15:49:10.858601944Z","tags":null},"/emil/cars/Subscription-models-a-plague-on-the-industry":{"title":"The wrath of subscription-based models","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-06T15:49:10.858601944Z","tags":null},"/emil/projects/Engineering-Design-Portfolio":{"title":"Engineering Design portfolio","content":"## Overview\n\nThis project was completed as part of Warwick's Engineering Design module. The main task involved the creation of an a abrasive blasting helmet, given a fictional brief. The company on which the brief was based on was **Elcometer**, a producer of measuring and safety equipment.\n\n## Design Process\n\nMany changes and ideas were taken into account during the design of this helmet. Lots of work had to be done in getting to grips with Fusion 360 CAD, as this was my first introduction to it. \n\nIt was also important to consider the engineering lifeycle of the product - an important consideration for an engineering product proposal. Essentially, my design process followed a system of:\n\n- Research\n- Conceptualisation\n- Prototyping\n- Testing (CAE)\n- Changes\n- Proposal\n\n## Result\n\nBelow are some images of the final design that I chose. You can see some of the features I've incorporated into it to meet the brief of the client, as well as some polished renders as part of my final presenatation.\n\n![Slide 1](/emil/images/slide1.png)\n![Slide 2](/emil/images/slide2.png)\n![Slide 3](/emil/images/slide3.png)","lastmodified":"2022-04-06T15:49:10.878601835Z","tags":null},"/emil/projects/Engineering-Dragster-Group-Project":{"title":"Engineering Dragster Group Project","content":"\u003e**Link to the 3D model** [here](https://emiltsi.github.io/)\n\n## Overview\n\nThis group project was completed as part of Warwick's Engineering Design module. The main task involved the creation of a self-powered dragster, which worked off spring tension and gear ratios to drive the rear axle.\n\n## The project\n\nThere were limited materials provided, including:\n\n1. An A4 sheet of acrylic\n2. Access to an Ultimaker 3D Printer\n3. Some plastic gears and metal axles.\n\nLots of work was done on Fusion 360 in terms of CAE. Static stress analysis was applied on the 3D printed wheels to determine safety factors, stresses and strains exerted on the wheels themselves.\n\nOverall, the project tested my abilities in manufacturing and working as a team under a strict deadline. Lots of lessons were learned, both in terms of time management and the importance of collboration in a team.\n\nOur final model was quite successful - below is a render of the final product.
