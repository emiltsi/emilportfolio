Alpina are known for their tuning of BMW chassis platforms, tuned for the Autobahn and understated performance. The cars are, for the most part, bespoke to their BMW counterpart in that they share different VINs and engine components. The move is bold - no doubt - but does it have any value?\n\n## Brand restructure\n\nBMW says that this acquisition is part of a strategic remodel for the brand, as part of the company's move towards sustainable mobility and development of their M brand (which will now be alongside Alpina). \n\nIt may well be a necessity, given the global and national movement towards electrification:\n\n\u003eThe transformation towards electromobility result in significantly higher risks for small-series manufacturers. \n\n\\- Andreas Bovensiepen, Alpina co-managing director\n\nBMW doesn't want the Alpina brand to go amiss, and so acquiring the operations of the company secures its future in the rocky landscape faced by car manufacturers at the moment, between chip shortages and mounting pressures to go fully sustainable.\n\n## Is Alpina's future doomed?\n\nGiving BMW free rein over Alpina's operations and models could spell disaster for the brand's heritage and exclusivity, given BMW's current peculiar decisions in terms of design and branding (the G80 M3 is one such example). So, what could realistically happen?\n\n### Alpina trim level\n\nOne such 'watering-down' could be in the form of condemning the brand to a simple trim level, in the same way that 'M-Sport' has become ubiquitous with a 150hp 318d. I'm not so sure whether adding an Alpina trim, alongside the M-Sport, would do wonders for the brand's image. The only real positive here is a wider recognition of the brand. Although, if presented alongside fully-fledged Alpina models, then I can see the benefit in doing so.\n\n### EV sub-brand?\n\nTurning Alpina into an electric sub-brand, in the same way Polestar has with Volvo, isn't out of the realm of possibility. At least this way, BMW has something to differentiate between ICE M vehicles and EV Alpina models. Again, it would also fit the concept of 'understated performance' which Alpina bases itself on. This is a viable idea, especially in terms of preserving the image of the company. That is, despite those who state that this would be the end of Alpina's legacy once and for all. \n\nHowever, BMW already has a dedicated EV vision - its 'i' brand. Mixing the two could spell confusion for consumers and the whole EV model range, especially alongside new players such as the iX and i4. Besides, by 2035 BMW is unlikely to have *any* ICE vehicles in its line-up - so is there any point in differentiating EV models? EVs will overshadow ICE vehicles very quickly in the next decade, so maybe an effort towards an Alpina offshoot may be in vain. \n\n### Worldwide expansion\n\nAmerican customers would appreciate a wider range of Alpina models in North America. At the moment, the US only receives the B7, B8 and XB7. Given BMW's financial backing, the addition of the well-loved B3 and smaller CUV models like the XB3 would widen product selection for North American customers.\n\nThis is especially true for the B3 Touring, since it would be a direct alternative to the M3 Touring, which isn't coming to the US - despite the requests of thousands of willing buyers in the US domestic market. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor now, the direction of Alpina is purely in BMW's hands. What happens next will have to be seen - although, there is still a lot of hope for the brand. Enthusiasts no doubt love the brand just as much as the people at BMW themselves do, so the future could be bright for Alpina. I hope the name remains synonymous with what the brand has created since 1965.","lastmodified":"2022-05-02T22:51:47.047116072Z","tags":null},"/emil/cars/Are-subscription-models-the-future":{"title":"Are subscription models the future?","content":"## Overview \n\nSpotify, Amazon Prime, Netflix. These are some of the corporate giants who have found incredible success in pursuing subscription-based services for their platforms. It's an attractive model - you provide a set amount of money a month, and you receive unlimited access to a service you desire, with no commitment or upfront payment. In theory, it's great for the consumer and the producer. Well, any business model in theory is great. Does this translate well to services and features in a car though? That is a different question.\n\n## The Spotifisation of cars\n\nRecently, Mercedes unveiled that the rear-wheel steering system on their flagship EQS EV is placed behind a £418 subscription paywall for the customer to unlock. The base models provide only 4.5 degrees of tilt, and require this upgrade to unlock the full 10-degree angle to reduce the turning circle and aid manoeuvrability.\n\nAudi has been engaging in similar behaviour as seen in a viral [Reddit video](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/tk43nu/thank_you_audi/), where basic HVAC functions were blocked for a certain customer in Denmark upon pressing a button. Instead, the infotainment showed a message proclaiming that the function had not yet been purchased.\n\nI have personal experience with this. Someone I know owns an F40 1 Series, clad with the necessary sensors and buttons for high-beam assist in the headlights from factory. However, upon pressing the button the activate it on the indicator stalk, you are urged to *purchase* the feature on the BMW Store for a one-off sum of £160 from the ConnectedDrive store. \n\n![High Beam Assist purchase](/emil/images/subscription1.png)\n![High Beam Assist purchase 2](/emil/images/subscription2.png)\n\nIn the advent of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things, basing vehicles on software in this way is undoubtedly the future. Tesla has arguably been the innovator in this, but BMW has recently released 5G for the first time as part of their iDrive 8.0 infotainment system.\n\nIn some ways, it makes sense. Doing this simplifies the manufacturing and economies of scale during production. For the most part, everything is already in the vehicle, so there is less variation and complexity on the production line.\n\nThe customer can then add features as they please, almost like apps. This is now very much integrated into apps like MyAudi, Volkswagen WeConnect and JLR InControl[^1], where features such as high-beam assist (as I mentioned) and adaptive cruise control can be added to the feature set of the vehicle. This is an improvement towards feature 'packages' most cars have nowadays, which sometimes contain redundant options a customer may not want. \n\nThe most glaring issue with this lays in the fact that spending the extra money and resources to incorporate features in the car (such as heated seats, active cruise control etc.) locked behind a paywall from factory seems slightly strange. Why provide a feature in a vehicle, and then lock it from the customer who is supposed to use it? In some senses, it's simply the product of the mass digitisation of our world. It's not necessarily a bad thing either - just something car users will have warm up to.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn my opinion, as long as these subscription services are left for less critical features (and preferably digital services such as traffic information, infotainment features etc.) and not forced upon the user, then it could work quite well. It's likely that the EU will introduce legislation regarding the terms of these products and services, which will increase trust in car manufacturers to do it right. There have no doubt been some recent blunders in how this system has been integrated recently, but as this becomes more polished it will very much be a normality.\n\n\n\n[^1]: The 2022 Range Rover is a perfect example of this, with their new over-the-air system architecture supporting 69 ECUs at once. This is alongside BMW's strong focus on car connectivity with 5G tech.","lastmodified":"2022-05-02T22:51:47.047116072Z","tags":null},"/emil/personal/April-15-2022":{"title":"April 15, 2022","content":"![Image 1](/emil/images/wrekinside.jpg)\n![Image 2](/emil/images/wrekintop.jpg)","lastmodified":"2022-05-02T22:51:47.143116424Z","tags":null},"/emil/personal/April-7-2022":{"title":"April 7, 2022","content":"![Image 1](/emil/images/april7-1.jpg)\n![Image 2](/emil/images/april7-2.jpg)","lastmodified":"2022-05-02T22:51:47.143116424Z","tags":null},"/emil/projects/Engineering-Design-Portfolio":{"title":"Engineering Design portfolio","content":"## Overview\n\nThis project was completed as part of Warwick's Engineering Design module. The main task involved the creation of an a abrasive blasting helmet, given a fictional brief. The company on which the brief was based on was **Elcometer**, a producer of measuring and safety equipment.\n\n## Design Process\n\nMany changes and ideas were taken into account during the design of this helmet. Lots of work had to be done in getting to grips with Fusion 360 CAD, as this was my first introduction to it. \n\nIt was also important to consider the engineering lifeycle of the product - an important consideration for an engineering product proposal. Essentially, my design process followed a system of:\n\n- Research\n- Conceptualisation\n- Prototyping\n- Testing (CAE)\n- Changes\n- Proposal\n\n## Result\n\nBelow are some images of the final design that I chose. You can see some of the features I've incorporated into it to meet the brief of the client, as well as some polished renders as part of my final presenatation.\n\n![Slide 1](/emil/images/slide1.png)\n![Slide 2](/emil/images/slide2.png)\n![Slide 3](/emil/images/slide3.png)","lastmodified":"2022-05-02T22:51:47.143116424Z","tags":null},"/emil/projects/Engineering-Dragster-Group-Project":{"title":"Engineering Dragster Group Project","content":"\u003e**Link to the 3D model** [here](https://warwick913.autodesk360.com/g/shares/SH35dfcQT936092f0e434e669fb6caf7e155)\n\n## Overview\n\nThis group project was completed as part of Warwick's Engineering Design module. The main task involved the creation of a self-powered dragster, which worked off spring tension and gear ratios to drive the rear axle. This project was completed in Term 2, after the [[Engineering Design Portfolio]].\n\n## The project\n\nThere were limited materials provided, including:\n\n1. An A4 sheet of acrylic\n2. Access to an Ultimaker 3D Printer\n3. Some plastic gears and metal axles.\n\nLots of work was done on Fusion 360 in terms of CAE. Static stress analysis was applied on the 3D printed wheels to determine safety factors, stresses and strains exerted on the wheels themselves.\n\nOverall, the project tested my abilities in manufacturing and working as a team under a strict deadline. Lots of lessons were learned, both in terms of time management and the importance of collboration in a team.\n\nOur final model was quite successful - below is a render of the final product.
