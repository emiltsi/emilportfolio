The main task involved the creation of an a abrasive blasting helmet, given a fictional brief. \n\n## Design Process\n\nMany changes and ideas were taken into account during the design of this helmet. Lots of work had to be done in getting to grips with Fusion 360 CAD, as this was my first introduction to it. It was also important to consider the engineering lifeycle of the product - an important consideration for an engineering product proposal\n\n## Result\n\nBelow are some images of the design. You can see some of the designs and features I've incorporated into it, as well as some polished renders as part of my final presenatation.\n\n![Slide 1](/emil/images/slide1.png)\n![Slide 2](/emil/images/slide2.png)\n![Slide 3](/emil/images/slide3.png)","lastmodified":"2022-04-05T19:39:36.441394812Z","tags":null},"/emil/projects/Engineering-Dragster-Group-Project":{"title":"Engineering Dragster Group Project","content":"**Link to the 3D model** [here](https://emiltsi.github.io/)\n\n## Overview\n\nThis group project was completed as part of Warwick's Engineering Design module. The main task involved the creation of a dragster.\n\n## The project\n\nThere were limited materials provided, including:\n\n1. An A4 sheet of acrylic\n2. Access to an Ultimaker 3D Printer\n3. Some plastic gears and metal axles.\n\nA lot of work was done on Fusion 360 in terms of CAE. Static stress analysis was applied on the 3D printed wheels to determine safety factors, stresses, strains and so on.\n\nOverall, the project tested my abilities in manufacturing and working as a team under a strict deadline. Our final model was quite successful, and can be seen in the photo below.\n\n![Image of dragster](/emil/images/dragster.png)","lastmodified":"2022-04-05T19:39:36.441394812Z","tags":null},"/emil/projects/Interactive-3D-website":{"title":"Interactive 3D website","content":"**Link to the website** [here](https://emilportfoliotest.vercel.app/)\n\n**Link to the GitHub repo** [here](https://github.com/emiltsi/portfoliotest/)\n\n## Overview\n\nThis website was made after my intial portfolio.

This was my first published website.\n\nI tried to incorporate a responsive design with a blue colour scheme. However, I wasn't fully happy with the design and layout of it (especially on mobile), so eventually decided to create the website you're on now.\n\n![Image of website](/emil/images/emiltsi.png)","lastmodified":"2022-04-05T19:39:36.441394812Z","tags":null}}
