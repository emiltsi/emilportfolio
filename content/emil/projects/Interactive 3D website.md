## Overview

This website was made after my intial portfolio. I made an interactive splash screen, including a free open-source model taken from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/free-porsche-911-carrera-4s-d01b254483794de3819786d93e0e1ebf). Credits go to [Raja Osama](https://https://github.com/Raja0sama/rm-portfolio), who provided a template for the website on GitHub.
 
Everything was made with Three.js and React.js elements. Feel free to click the link to take a look.
