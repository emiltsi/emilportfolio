## Overview
  
This group project was completed as part of Warwick's Engineering Design module. The main task involved the creation of a truss tower able to withstand a vibrating table whilst holding 500ml of water. This project was completed in Term 3, following the completion of the [[Mechanical Dragster Group Project]].

## The project

The material list was constrained to a limited number of various balsa wood strips (square, rectangular etc.). The only adhesive permitted to be used was hot glue, alongside access to an Ultimaker 3D printer for 50g of PLA parts.

Lots of work was done on Fusion 360 in terms of CAE. Static load simulations were created for various truss designs to determine which would be the most suitable approach. This involved calculations of buckling, second moment of inertia and safety factor.

Overall, the project was a challenging test of statics expertise, as well as more complicated modelling techniques using Fusion 360.

Below is a render of the final product. Please view the 3D web link at the top of the page to see an interactive model too.
