## Overview 

Spotify, Amazon Prime, Netflix. These are some of the corporate giants who have found incredible success in pursuing subscription-based services for their platforms. It's an attractive model - you provide a set amount of money a month, and you receive unlimited access to a service you desire, with no commitment or upfront payment. In theory, it's great for the consumer and the producer. Well, any business model in theory is great. Does this translate well to services and features in a car though? That is a different question.

## The Spotifisation of cars

Recently, Mercedes unveiled that the rear-wheel steering system on their flagship EQS EV is placed behind a Â£418 subscription paywall for the customer to unlock. The base models provide only 4.5 degrees of tilt, and require this upgrade to unlock the full 10-degree angle to reduce the turning circle and aid manoeuvrability.

Audi has been engaging in similar behaviour as seen in a viral [Reddit video](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/tk43nu/thank_you_audi/), where basic HVAC functions were blocked for a certain customer in Denmark upon pressing a button. Instead, the infotainment showed a message proclaiming that the function had not yet been purchased.

I have personal experience with this. Someone I know owns an F40 1 Series, which has the necessary sensors and buttons for high-beam assist in the headlights from factory. However, upon pressing the button the activate it on the signal stalk, you are urged to *purchase* the feature on the BMW Store for a one-off sum of a few hundred pounds.

The most glaring issue with this lays in the fact that spending the extra money and resources to incorporate features in the car (such as heated seats, active cruise control etc.) locked behind a paywall from factory seems slightly peculiar. Why provide a feature in a vehicle, and then lock it from the customer who is supposed to use it? This all makes a lot more sense for cloud and internet-based services, not physical ones.

On the other hand, there is a positive in that this simplifies the logistics and manufacturing supply chain somewhat, as there are now less variations of a particular car to make every single time. This is becoming especially relevant as buttons and features are being incorporated in the infotainment system. In the advent of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things, basing vehicles on software is undoubtedly the future. The average consumer of vehicles will benefit from this, in that the feature-set and overall ecosystem of a vehicle is very similar to other appliances that you would find in the home.

Alongside this, reducing the feature-set of a the car can help alleviate base costs. The driver can then easily decide whether they want to incorporate a feature into their vehicle selectively. This is an improvement towards feature 'packages' most cars have nowadays, which sometimes contain redundant options a customer may not want. 

## Conclusion

In my opinion, as long as these subscription services are left for less critical features (and preferably digital services relating the infotainment system) and not forced upon the user, then it could work. It's likely that the EU will introduce legislation regarding the terms of these products and services, which will increase trust in car manufacturers to do it right. It is a slippery slope, and one which I imagine some car manufacturers will have issues with integrating.
