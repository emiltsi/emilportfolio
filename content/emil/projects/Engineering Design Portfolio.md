## Overview

This project was completed as part of Warwick's Engineering Design module. The main task involved the creation of an a abrasive blasting helmet, given a fictional brief. The company on which the brief was based on was **Elcometer**, a producer of measuring and safety equipment.

## Design Process

Many changes and ideas were taken into account during the design of this helmet. Lots of work had to be done in getting to grips with Fusion 360 CAD, as this was my first introduction to it. 

It was also important to consider the engineering lifeycle of the product - an important consideration for an engineering product proposal. Essentially, my design process followed a system of:

- Research
- Conceptualisation
- Prototyping
- Testing (CAE)
- Changes
- Proposal

## Result

Below are some images of the final design that I chose. You can see some of the features I've incorporated into it to meet the brief of the client, as well as some polished renders as part of my final presenatation.
