## Overview

This group project was completed as part of Warwick's Engineering Design module. The main task involved the creation of a dragster.

## The project

There were limited materials provided, including:

1. An A4 sheet of acrylic
2. Access to an Ultimaker 3D Printer
3. Some plastic gears and metal axles.

A lot of work was done on Fusion 360 in terms of CAE. Static stress analysis was applied on the 3D printed wheels to determine safety factors, stresses, strains and so on.

Overall, the project tested my abilities in manufacturing and working as a team under a strict deadline. Our final model was quite successful, and can be seen in the photo below.
