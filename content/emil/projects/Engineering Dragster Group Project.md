## Overview

This group project was completed as part of Warwick's Engineering Design module. The main task involved the creation of a self-powered dragster, which worked off spring tension and gear ratios to drive the rear axle.

## The project

There were limited materials provided, including:

1. An A4 sheet of acrylic
2. Access to an Ultimaker 3D Printer
3. Some plastic gears and metal axles.

Lots of work was done on Fusion 360 in terms of CAE. Static stress analysis was applied on the 3D printed wheels to determine safety factors, stresses and strains exerted on the wheels themselves.

Overall, the project tested my abilities in manufacturing and working as a team under a strict deadline. Lots of lessons were learned, both in terms of time management and the importance of collboration in a team.

Our final model was quite successful - below is a render of the final product. Please view the 3D web link at the top of the page to see an interactive model too.
