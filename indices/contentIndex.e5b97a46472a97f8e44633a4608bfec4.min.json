The main task involved the creation of an a abrasive blasting helmet, given a fictional brief. The company on which the brief was based on was **Elcometer**, a producer of measuring and safety equipment.\n\n## Design Process\n\nMany changes and ideas were taken into account during the design of this helmet. Lots of work had to be done in getting to grips with Fusion 360 CAD, as this was my first introduction to it. \n\nIt was also important to consider the engineering lifeycle of the product - an important consideration for an engineering product proposal. Essentially, my design process followed a system of:\n\n- Research\n- Conceptualisation\n- Prototyping\n- Testing (CAE)\n- Changes\n- Proposal\n\n## Result\n\nBelow are some images of the final design that I chose. You can see some of the features I've incorporated into it to meet the brief of the client, as well as some polished renders as part of my final presenatation.\n\n![Slide 1](/emil/images/slide1.png)\n![Slide 2](/emil/images/slide2.png)\n![Slide 3](/emil/images/slide3.png)","lastmodified":"2022-04-05T20:44:28.221947451Z","tags":null},"/emil/projects/Engineering-Dragster-Group-Project":{"title":"Engineering Dragster Group Project","content":"**Link to the 3D model** [here](https://emiltsi.github.io/)\n\n## Overview\n\nThis group project was completed as part of Warwick's Engineering Design module. The main task involved the creation of a self-powered dragster, which worked off spring tension and gear ratios to drive the rear axle.\n\n## The project\n\nThere were limited materials provided, including:\n\n1. An A4 sheet of acrylic\n2. Access to an Ultimaker 3D Printer\n3. Some plastic gears and metal axles.\n\nLots of work was done on Fusion 360 in terms of CAE. Static stress analysis was applied on the 3D printed wheels to determine safety factors, stresses and strains exerted on the wheels themselves.\n\nOverall, the project tested my abilities in manufacturing and working as a team under a strict deadline. Lots of lessons were learned, both in terms of time management and the importance of collboration in a team.\n\nOur final model was quite successful - below is a render of the final product.

This was my first published website.\n\nI tried to incorporate a responsive design with a blue colour scheme. However, I wasn't fully happy with the design and layout of it (especially on mobile), so eventually decided to create the website you're on now.\n\n![Image of website](/emil/images/emiltsi.png)","lastmodified":"2022-04-05T20:44:28.221947451Z","tags":null}}
