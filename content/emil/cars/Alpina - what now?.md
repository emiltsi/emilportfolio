## Overview

BMW has finally added legendary tuner Alpina to its brand portfolio, after more than 50 years of collaboration at its Buchloe plant in Bavaria. Alpina are known for their tuning of BMW chassis platforms, tuned for the Autobahn and understated performance. The cars are, for the most part, bespoke to their BMW counterpart in that they share different VINs and engine components. The move is bold - no doubt - but does it have any value?

## Brand restructure

BMW says that this acquisition is part of a strategic remodel for the brand, as part of the company's move towards sustainable mobility and development of their M brand (which will now be alongside Alpina). 

It may well be a necessity, given the global and national movement towards electrification:

>The transformation towards electromobility result in significantly higher risks for small-series manufacturers. 

\- Andreas Bovensiepen, Alpina co-managing director

BMW doesn't want the Alpina brand to go amiss, and so acquiring the operations of the company secures its future in the rocky landscape faced by car manufacturers at the moment, between chip shortages and mounting pressures to go fully sustainable.

## Is Alpina's future doomed?

Giving BMW free rein over Alpina's operations and models could spell disaster for the brand's heritage and exclusivity, given BMW's current peculiar decisions in terms of design and branding (the G80 M3 is one such example). So, what could realistically happen?

### Alpina trim level

One such 'watering-down' could be in the form of condemning the brand to a simple trim level, in the same way that 'M-Sport' has become ubiquitous with a 150hp 318d. I'm not so sure whether adding an Alpina trim, alongside the M-Sport, would do wonders for the brand's image. The only real positive here is a wider recognition of the brand. Although, if presented alongside fully-fledged Alpina models, then I can see the benefit in doing so.

### EV sub-brand?

Turning Alpina into an electric sub-brand, in the same way Polestar has with Volvo, isn't out of the realm of possibility. At least this way, BMW has something to differentiate between ICE M vehicles and EV Alpina models. Again, it would also fit the concept of 'understated performance' which Alpina bases itself on. This is a viable idea, especially in terms of preserving the image of the company. That is, despite those who state that this would be the end of Alpina's legacy once and for all. 

However, BMW already has a dedicated EV vision - its 'i' brand. Mixing the two could spell confusion for consumers and the whole EV model range, especially alongside new players such as the iX and i4. Besides, by 2035 BMW is unlikely to have *any* ICE vehicles in its line-up - so is there any point in differentiating EV models? EVs will overshadow ICE vehicles very quickly in the next decade, so maybe an effort towards an Alpina offshoot may be in vain. 

### Worldwide expansion

American customers would appreciate a wider range of Alpina models in North America. At the moment, the US only receives the B7, B8 and XB7. Given BMW's financial backing, the addition of the well-loved B3 and smaller CUV models like the XB3 would widen product selection for North American customers.

This is especially true for the B3 Touring, since it would be a direct alternative to the M3 Touring, which isn't coming to the US - despite the requests of thousands of willing buyers in the US domestic market. 

## Conclusion

For now, the direction of Alpina is purely in BMW's hands. What happens next will have to be seen - although, there is still a lot of hope for the brand. Enthusiasts no doubt love the brand just as much as the people at BMW themselves do, so the future could be bright for Alpina. I hope the name remains synonymous with what the brand has created since 1965.
